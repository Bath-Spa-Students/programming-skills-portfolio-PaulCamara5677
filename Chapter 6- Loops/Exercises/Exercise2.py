## Exercise 2: Movie Tickets: :ballot_box_with_check

#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if
##they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their 
###age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

while True:
    age = input("what is your age? ")
    if age == 'quit':
        break
    age = int(age)
    if age <3:
        print("Your ticket is free of charge.")
    elif age < 13:
        print("Your ticket is $10 on the account of discount." )
    else:
        print("Your ticket is $15.")
